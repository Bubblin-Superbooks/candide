The company in great surprise looked at one another without speaking a word, when another domestic approached his master and said to him:</p><p>"Sire, your Majesty's chaise is at Padua, and the boat is ready."</p><p>The master gave a nod and the servant went away. The company all stared at one another again, and their surprise redoubled. A third valet came up to a third stranger, saying:</p><p>"Sire, believe me, your Majesty ought not to stay here any longer. I am going to get everything ready."</p></div> </div>
