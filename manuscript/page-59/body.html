The History Of Cunegonde.</h3><p>"I was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased God to send the Bulgarians to our delightful castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh; they slew my father and brother, and cut my mother in pieces. A tall Bulgarian, six feet high, perceiving that I had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me; this made me recover; I regained my senses, I cried, I struggled, I bit, I scratched, I wanted to tear out the tall Bulgarian's eyesâ€”not knowing that what happened at my father's house was the usual practice of war. The brute gave me a cut in the left side with his hanger, and the mark is still upon me."</p><p>"Ah! I hope I shall see it," said honest Candide.</p><p>"You shall," said Cunegonde, "but let us continue."</p><p>"Do so," replied Candide.</p></div> </div>
